Exquisite Clock is a ongoing collection of time fragments – hours, minutes and seconds that that populate everyday life.The project consists of a participatory website that feeds data to different clocks installed around the world.
<br><br>
 Through the website, users are invited to upload images of found nambers. Digits that are easily spoted around them – objects, surfaces, bodies that form shapes of numbers. All uploaded numbers then are tagged according to theirtheme and become part of a ever-growing a database of numbers.
<br><br>
Fed by this database, variations of screen clocks are constructed – clocks of objects, clock formed by money numbers, clocks formed by body parts, landscape clocks – and embodied in form of installations spread around the world, all accessing the same image database;platform of participation and exchange, where time takes different forms and appear in different territories.
